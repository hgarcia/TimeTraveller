A library to work with date and time.

h3. Purpose

Time traveller is my attempt to provide a better api to work with date and time operations.
My hope is to grow this library to make working with dates as enjoyable as possible.

h3. Objects

h4. TimeTraveller

Factory object to extend Date with some utility methods to do comparison and perform common operations on dates. 

As of version 0.2.1 only has a now() factory method that's equivalent to doing new Date().

h4. TimeSpan

A simple object tha represents a period of time. As of version 0.2.1 a TimeSpan object can be created in 3 ways.

<em>Calling the differenceFrom(secondDate) method on an enhanced Date object.</em>

<code>
var d = new TimeTraveller().now();<br/>
var ts = d.differenceFrom(new Date()); 

</code>

<em>Passing milliseconds into the constructor</em>

<code>
var ts = new TimeSpan(1300);
</code>

<em>Passing two dates into the contructor</em>

<code>
var ts = new TimeSpan(date, secondDate);
</code>
